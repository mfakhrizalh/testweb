          <h1>Kotori Itsuka (五河 琴里)</h1>        
          <h2>Commander Fraxinus</h2>
          <p>Is one of the main female characters of the Date A Live series. 
             She is Shido's foster sister and secretly works as the commander of the "Fraxinus" airship. 
             She is considered the fourth Spirit to appear, as her powers were not revealed when she debuted.</p>

          <div id="about">

            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Kotori Itsuka is Shido's foster little sister; she is also a middle school student as well as a commander of a secret organization known as <Ratatoskr> that deals with extraordinary beings known as Spirits through peaceful means.
               Five years prior to the beginning of "Date A Live", the naïve young Kotori was tricked by a mysterious being that turned her into a Spirit. Not long afterward, she was told about the method of how to seal her power by the same being that had given her that power. When everything had been carried out successfully, Kotori, whose power had been sealed, and Shido, who seems to have the ability to seal Kotori's power, both had their memories of that event suppressed. It was not until the present time, five years later, that Kotori personally uses her Spirit powers for the second time in order to save Shido from Kurumi. It was not until Shido resealed Kotori's Spirit powers that they finally remembered that event, and soon afterward they later dub the mysterious “being” unofficially with the codename "Phantom.
               "Kotori, being a commander of "Ratatoskr", knows certain information that only selective "Ratatoskr" members would know.</p>

            <div id="personality">

              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Kotori has three different personalities depending on the situation at hand. As a human, her character changes according to the color of the ribbons she's wearing. While wearing white ribbons or not wearing any, she is that of her "weak self", a delicate little sister who is very dependent upon her big brother; and when wearing black ribbons, she becomes her "strong self", a charismatic and sometimes domineering leader able to successfully command the airship, Fraxinus. The personalities are considered “little sister mode” and “commander mode” respectively. According to Reine, the Kotori with white ribbons is the one that can honestly say how she feels, which would mean that the Kotori with black ribbons is only putting a strong front because the situation requires so.
                 In her Spirit form, Kotori acts the same as her ribbons' current color indicates. But if she stays in her spirit form for too long, her third, "Spirit personality," takes over and she becomes an aggressive and merciless killing machine, who only cares about battling enemies to death. It could be said that fighting strong opponents (and utterly destroying them) is her only interest. She is best described as a sadist when in this state.
                 In all three cases, Kotori seems to have an 'S' side. Also, her deep feelings for Shido are always present, regardless of her current personality and help her remember who she truly is. No matter what the situation is, she will always be Shido's little sister.</p>

              <div id="appearance">

                <h1>Appearance</h1>
                <p>Kotori is a cute middle school girl with red eyes and very long, light coral-colored hair that is usually tied on both sides with ribbons in a variety of colors called the twintail hairstyle. She also has an Anime antenna hair (アホ毛, ahoge?) that always sticks out on the top of her head. Usually, she can be seen with her favorite Chupa Chups lollipop stick hanging from her mouth. She is 145 cm, and her three sizes are B72/W53/H74.
                   While wearing white ribbons, Kotori usually wears her school's signature white uniform with a black tie, a short teal-colored skirt, and long black stockings that reach up to half of her thigh. But when she wears black ribbons, her clothes and personality change, as she tends to wear maid-like sleeve clothes, with a black skirt and stockings.
                   In 'commander mode', Kotori wears black ribbons. To go along with her position as the commander of the Fraxinus, she wears a red coat over a white uniform like a cap, a black tie with red sidelines, a red skirt with white cloth-like sticking out and a pair of long, black boots that reach up to half her thigh. Her coat is usually draped over her shoulders, but she wears it properly during formal meetings. After the events of Tohka Good End, she begins wearing both her white and black ribbon at the same time.
                   Kotori's Astral Dress is a white kimono resembling a goddess's robes from Japanese folklore, with a revealing neckline, a translucent sash, and her black ribbons tied around a pair of oni-like horns, leaving her hair to fall freely. The ribbons also gain gold flower patterns on them.</p>
